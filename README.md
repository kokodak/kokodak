녀석들이 말하는 '새 시대' 란 건 엿 같은 얘기다. 해적이 꿈을 꾸는 시대가 끝난다고....?!사람의 꿈은!!! 끝나지 않아!!!! 다른 사람을 능가하는 것도 쉽지가 않아! 비웃음을 사면서 가면 좀 어떠냐!높은 곳을 향하다 보면 주먹을 내지 말아야 할 싸움도 있는 법이지. 어이, 그렇지 않냐! 어이쿠, 방해였나 보군. 갈 길이 급하겠지?
갈 수 있으면 좋겠군, 하늘섬에! 제하하하하하! || comment by [dooboocookie](https://github.com/dooboocookie)

If there are 8 billion fans of kokodak in the world, I would be the one of them.
If there are a million fans of kokodak in the world, I would be the one of them.
If there are a thousand fans of kokodak in the world, I would be the one of them.
If there are 10 fans of kokodak in the world, I still would be the one of them.
If there is only one fan of kokodak in the world, that person would be me.
If there isn't any fan of kokodak in the world, then I no longer exist in the world.

kokodak, my lord.
kokodak, my light.
kokodak, my sun.
kokodak, my life.
kokodak, my soul.
kokodak, me. || comment by [bagzaru](https://github.com/bagzaru)
